    "### Importing libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Python, you must always begin your scripts by importing the libraries that you will be using. After importing a library, its functions can then be called from your code by prepending the library name to the function name.  For example, to use the '`dot`' function from the '`numpy`' library, you would enter '`numpy.dot`'.  To avoid repeatedly having to type the libary name in your scripts, it is conventional to define a two or three letter abbreviation for each library, e.g. '`numpy`' is usually abbreviated as '`np`'.  This allows us to use '`np.dot`' instead of '`numpy.dot`'.  Similarly, the Pandas library is typically abbreviated as '`pd`'.\n",

This is a somewhat obscure format, and while Pandas is perfectly capable of reading the NHANES data directly from the xport files, accomplishing this task is a more advanced topic than we want to get into here.  Therefore, for this course we have prepared some merged datasets in the very common text/csv format."

    "Pandas is a large and powerful library.  Here we will only use a few of its basic features.  The main data structure that Pandas works with is called a \"data frame\".  This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically represent cases (e.g. NHANES subjects), and the columns represent variables.  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a `Series` that we will also encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a variety of functions named with the pattern '`read_xxx`' for reading data in different formats into Python.  Right now we will focus on reading comma-separated '`csv`' files, so we are using the '`read_csv`' function, which can read csv format files that are exported from spreadsheet software like Excel.  The '`read_csv`' function by default expects the first row of the data file to contain column names, and these are used to name the columns of the dataframe created from your data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using '`read_csv`' in its default mode is fairly straightforward.  There are many options to '`read_csv`' that are useful for handling less-common situations.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for '`read_csv`'.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first argument to '`read_csv`' is usually either a URL (an internet address), or the name of a file on your computer.  For example, the variable '`url`' below holds a string (text) value, which is the internet URL where the data are located.  If you have the data file in your local filesystem, you would pass a file path as the first argument instead of a URL, e.g. `pd.read_csv(\"my_file.csv\")` would read a file named `my_file.csv` that is located in your current working directory."

In practice, there may be a variety of distinct reasons that a value in a dataset may be missing, and it may be important to consider this information in your analysis.  For example, in the case of the 'DMDEDUC2' variable, in addition to the blank or NA values that Pandas considers to be missing, three people responded \"don't know\" (code value 9).  In many analyses, the \"don't know\" values will also be treated as missing, but at this point we are considering \"don't know\" to be a distinct category of observed response."
