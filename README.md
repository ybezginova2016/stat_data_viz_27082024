# Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python (University of Michigan)

This repository contains resources and exercises from the course **Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python**, which is part of the **Statistics with Python Specialization** offered by the **University of Michigan**.

## Course Overview

In this course, learners are introduced to the field of statistics, covering topics such as study design, data management, and data visualization. The course focuses on identifying different types of data, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting summaries for both univariate and multivariate data. Additionally, it includes an exploration of probability and non-probability sampling and how to make inferences about larger populations based on probability sampling.

At the end of each week, learners apply statistical concepts using Python within the course environment, utilizing libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The course uses the Jupyter Notebook environment for practical exercises.
